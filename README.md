👋🏽 Hi, my name is Simant

🎓 Soon to be grad with a Master's Of Engineering in Computer Science. (May 2023)

🇳🇵 Nepali, with a passion for learning new things and adding the X-factor in any place that I work at.

📚 Graduated from Vellore Institue of Technology with Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology. Learned a lot about different technologies, algorithms, and many programming languages. I got to do a lot of class projects individually and in a group. These all experiences taught me how to handle pressure at tough times and find an optimal way to solve a problem.

💻 As for my future, I hope to one day work as Software Engineer and work with a diverse team. In an MNC.

🏔 In my free time I like to watch TV Series and hang out with my friends and family. I also love to play cricket and FIFA. I have got a new hobby to fly drones and edit that footage.
